* pdftotext with accents
This little =pdftotext= (part of the [[%20http://poppler.freedesktop.org/][Poppler PDF library]]) wrapper translates special combinations of characters to the corresponding accented characters.
* Motivation
Often when a PDF document is generated using LaTeX, the special accented UTF-8 characters in the source code will be translated to a combination of the base character and the accent character, e.g. =á= will become  =´a=.
This wrapper translates these combinations using regular expressions and a lookup dictionary.
* Usage
Pipe the =STDOUT= of =pdftotext= to STDIN of this script and redirect =STDOUT= of this script to some file or pipe.
Examplein BASH: =pdftotext file.pdf - | pdftotext_with_accents > file.txt=
* License
GPL-3+ and a sincere request that you use 
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
#+END_SRC
in you LaTeX documents from now on to have all those accented characters typeset correctly.
